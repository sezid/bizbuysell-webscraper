#  BizBuySell Web Scraper  

## üìå Overview  
This Python-based **web scraper** extracts business listings from **BizBuySell**, focusing on owner-financed and established businesses. It collects details such as **title, location, asking price, cash flow, reason for selling, broker details, and phone numbers** from multiple pages.  

The scraper works in two steps:  
1. **Scrapes main listings** (title, location, asking price, cash flow, and links).  
2. **Extracts additional details** (broker name, reason for selling, and phone number) by visiting individual listing pages.

## üìä CSV Data Format  

The extracted data is saved in **`listings.csv`** with the following columns:  

| Title                                     | Location          | Asking Price | Cash Flow         | Link                                                                                     | Reason for Selling       | Broker Name                   | Phone Number  |
